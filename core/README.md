# OTK application core

OTK is the main application. Its core owns config/authentication, reflective
HTTP routing, WebSocket transport, the live session index and feature-owned RPC
adapters. Reusable kit libraries supply protocol, content, backend contracts and
persistence. Opencode is one backend; core services accept any `Harness`.

## Application composition

Root `main.ts` selects the backend/content buffers, resolves layered config and
web assets, and owns process signals. Root `application.ts` supplies the shipped
store migrations and feature registrations through
`startApplication(cfg, backend, staticRoot)`. External-backend fixtures use that
same composition; subprocess fixtures launch `main.ts` directly.
`startCore({ cfg, backend, store, prefs, rpc, staticRoot })` starts that backend
and the application's reflective Pathfinder HTTP/WS service. Its `CoreServer`
exposes `server`, `backend`, `index`, `connections` and `stop()`. Stop closes
connections, stops the backend, shuts down HTTP and closes the store; the
application owns this lifetime.

`RpcRegistry(backend, store)` dispatches registered methods and gives handlers
`RpcContext` (`harness`, `store`, authoritative `sessionDirectory(id)`).
Features own `params` validation and `handler`; `register(method, definition)`
rejects duplicate names. Invalid params and handler errors propagate to the WS
request owner. Unknown/unregistered methods return the existing `method` error.

`registerSessions`, `registerPrefs` and `registerFrecency` provide core and
store features; prefs/frecency take their store as a third argument. Optional
`registerPrompt`, `registerShell`, `registerCommands`, `registerHistory`,
`registerFiles`, `registerAgents`, `registerResources`, `registerPermissions`,
`registerQuestions` and `registerRevert` register only when their backend
capability exists. Registry machinery never composes those features;
`application.ts` does. `prefsOptions` and `frecencyOptions` retain OTK
preference/path validation.

The existing `welcome.sidecar.harness` wire shape gains a `capabilities` array
advertising present backend capabilities. Consumers gate optional features on
it. Core sessions, prefs and frecency need no optional backend capabilities.
Existing `OTK_HARNESS_*`, cookie, origin and protocol names remain compatible.
Older welcome frames without the new field retain their legacy RPC families;
explicit empty/subset advertisements remain authoritative. Both browser
consumers use the protocol's shared normalization. Feature metadata stays cached
while transport reconnects so dirty permission/question owners remain mounted.

`loadServiceConfig` takes explicit defaults/overlay/auth-state/environment
inputs. `config(sources)` additionally loads generated auth state and resolves
its state directory; root bootstrap owns memoization and default paths.
`AuthState`, `LocalAuth`, password helpers and `allowedOrigin` retain
cookie/origin/JWT/TOTP behavior. `Connections`, `IndexStore`, `serve`,
`staticResponse`, `promptParts`, `object` and `text` are shared core
implementation helpers.

## Example

[`example.ts`](./example.ts) illustrates an alternate sessions/prompt
application composition accepting a backend, config and asset directory:

```ts
import type { Harness } from "@otk/harness";
import { OtkDb, Prefs, prefsMigrations } from "@otk/store";
import {
  prefsOptions,
  registerPrefs,
  registerPrompt,
  registerSessions,
  RpcRegistry,
  type ServiceConfig,
  startCore,
} from "./mod.ts";

async function run(backend: Harness, cfg: ServiceConfig, staticRoot: string) {
  const store = new OtkDb(cfg.state.path, prefsMigrations);
  const prefs = new Prefs(store, prefsOptions);
  const rpc = new RpcRegistry(backend, store);
  registerSessions(rpc, backend);
  registerPrompt(rpc, backend);
  registerPrefs(rpc, backend, prefs);
  rpc.register("example.directory", {
    params: () => "example-session",
    handler: (ctx, id) => ctx.sessionDirectory(id),
  });
  return await startCore({ cfg, backend, store, prefs, rpc, staticRoot });
}
```

The application chooses all shipped registrations in root `application.ts`.
Adding a feature needs its registration in caller composition, never a central
dispatch edit. HTTP handlers remain discovered from `http/routes/`, including
API auth middleware; there is no handwritten route table.

`core/mod.ts` is a local application convenience entry, not a workspace package.
The smaller [`example.ts`](./example.ts) is retained as an alternate
composition; its core-only routes and absence of optional RPCs are covered by
the service test.

Core tests live in `tests/unit/core/`; application integration/e2e tests stay at
root. They cover config, auth/index, RPC validation/capability absence and
actual HTTP/WS/browser behavior. Library units stay in their packages. Core is
not a separate JSR package: public-entry/dry-run checks apply only to reusable
libraries. Run project workloads inside the assigned OTK VM.
`tests/integration/composition_test.ts` additionally observes the shipped
composition through the public framework-free client: external backend index and
transcript, capability-selected RPC forwarding, preference broadcast and
persisted prefs/frecency after an application restart. The separate minimal-core
service test preserves alternate selected-registration HTTP/static/SPA/origin
coverage.
